I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Archiplab](https://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~maks/index.html), Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences ([IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)), Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Kaisheng Ma. My research interests primarily focused on multicore/chiplet DNN accelerator architecture and compilation, silicon photonics wafer-scale computing architecture. My work, Gemini, on co-exploring the mapping and architecture of DNN chiplet accelerators was awarded the <b style="color:red;">Distinguished Artifact Award</b> at top conference on computer architecture, <b style="color:red;">HPCA</b>. This marks the <b style="color:red;">first time</b> a team from China has received this honor at HPCA. Moreover, I led the compilation team at Polar Bear Tech to build a scalable compiler for a 12nm high-computing autonomous driving accelerator, based on our work presented at ISCA. This compiler encompasses model processing, graph scheduling, tile partitioning, IR generation, instruction generation, cycle-accurate simulators.,etc.
  
I earned a B.S. degree in Integrated Circuit and System Design from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). During my undergraduate studies, I achieved a weighted average score of 95.3, ranking first in his department and breaking the record in the university. I was also honored with the title of Outstanding Student of UESTC, a prestigious distinction awarded annually to only ten graduates, akin to the Tsinghua Special Award. Furthermore, I have received more than ten scholarships, including three National Scholarships. Notably, during the Youth Day celebrations of 2021, I was among the 100 national scholarship recipients featured in People's Daily.

***For more information, please refer to my CV. I am expected to graduate in 2026 and am currently seeking internship and employment opportunities in the industry.***
