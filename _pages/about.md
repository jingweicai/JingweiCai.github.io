I am currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student at Archiplab, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. Kaisheng Ma. My research interests primarily focused on multicore/chiplet DNN accelerator architecture and compilation, silicon photonics wafer-scale computing architecture. My academic works have been widely adopted to varying degrees by numerous academic groups and industries. I have also actively promoted the practical application of these works. Currently, I lead a team implementing these works in multiple generations of high-performance autonomous driving chips and two compiler generations at Polar Bear Tech.

***For more information, please refer to my CV. I am expected to graduate in 2026 and am currently seeking employment opportunities with talent plan in the industry.***
